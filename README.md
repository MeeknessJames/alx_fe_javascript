# Inspirational Quotes App

This project is my hands-on exploration of **front-end development**, focusing on **DOM manipulation**, **local storage**, and **JSON data usage**. The app provides users with an interactive experience to discover, save, and manage inspirational quotes.

## Features

- **Random Quote Generator:** Displays a random quote from a JSON dataset.
- **Interactive UI:** Updates the interface dynamically whenever users interact with the app.
- **Persistent Favorites:** Lets users save their favorite quotes using `localStorage` so they remain available across sessions.
- **JSON-Driven Content:** Loads quotes from a JSON file and displays them seamlessly in the browser.

## How It Works

1. **Load Quotes:** On opening the app, quotes are fetched from a JSON source.
2. **Display Random Quotes:** A random quote appears on the screen for inspiration.
3. **Save Favorite Quotes:** Users can save quotes they like, which are stored in `localStorage`.
4. **View & Manage Favorites:** Users can view, delete, or manage saved quotes anytime, even after refreshing the page.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/inspirational-quotes-app.git
